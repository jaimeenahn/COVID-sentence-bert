This directory contains tiny training samples for running the code. 

* `data.json` containing the document ids and their relationship.  
* `metadata.json` containing mapping of document ids to textual fiels (e.g., `title`, `abstract`)
* `train.txt`,`val.txt`, `test.txt` containing document ids corresponding to train/val/test sets (one doc id per line).

The `data.json` file should have the following structure (a nested dict):  
```ruby
{"docid1" : {  "docid11": {"count": 1}, 
               "docid12": {"count": 5},
               "docid13": {"count": 1}, ....
            }
"docid2":   {  "docid21": {"count": 1}, ....
....}
```
